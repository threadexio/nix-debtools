# nix-debtools

A cursed flake that provides a collection of nix constructs to help you use
_Nix_ to build packages for _Debian_. Why? Because sometimes science isn't about
why... it's about why _not_. And also because this flake builds actually
reproducible Debian packages.

- [`API Reference`](./reference.md)

## What this is

This is intended to serve as a way to provide `.deb` packages from a single
build system written in Nix.

## What this is NOT

- This is **NOT** a replacement to packaging for Debian.
- It has many issues.
- Is a complete hack.
